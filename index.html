<h4>
    Hakuna matata! What a wonderful phrase!
    Hakuna matata! It ain't no passing craze!
    It means no worries for the rest of your days
    It's our problem-free philosophy
    Hakuna matata

    Hakuna matata?
    Yeah, it's our motto
    What's a motto?
    Nothin', what's the motto with you?
    Ace! Boom!
    Those two words will solve all your problems
    Yeah, take Pumbaa, here

    Why, when he was a young warthog
    When I was a young warthog
    How you feelin'? It's an emotional story
    He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
    He could clear the Savannah after every meal
    I'm a sensitive soul although I seem thick-skinned
    And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
    I was here for you, and I resent that
    And, oh, the shame!
    Yes, he was ashamed
    I thought of changing my name!
    I mean, to what? "Brad"?
    And I got downhearted
    Every time that I farted... are you gonna stop me?
    No, I'm not. You disgust me!

    Hakuna matata! What a wonderful phrase!
    Hakuna matata! It ain't no passing craze!
    It means no worries for the rest of your days (Yeah, sing it, kid)
    It's our problem-free philosophy
    Hakuna matata

    It means no worries for the rest of your days
    It's our problem-free philosophy
    Hakuna matata! (Hakuna matata, hakuna matata)
    Hakuna matata, yeah (Hakuna matata, hakuna matata)
    Hakuna matata, oh, ah (Hakuna matata, hakuna matata)
    It means no worries for the rest of your days
    It's our problem-free philosophy
    Hakuna matata

    One more time
    Oh, no, I think we did it (I think we got this one)
    But we're just getting in the groove
    No, let's leave 'em wanting more
    Yeah, you've grown 400 pounds since we started
    Meanwhile, I look exactly the same
    It means no worries, oh, yeah
    Will you tell him to stop
    Well, you insisted we sing this song
    I insisted you started singing it!
    It's our signature song, we shouldn't be sharing it!
    But it's our signature song so we have to
    Look, just tell him to stop
    It means no worries, ah, oh
    Oh, now he's riffing, Pumbaa, this is a nightmare
    It actually is kinda getting better
